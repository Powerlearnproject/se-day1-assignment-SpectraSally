Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves the application of engineering principles in software development, testing, and maintenance. It is important in playing a significant role in creation of software systems and applications that power diverse aspects of life today; including, healthcare, communication and commerce.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the 1960s software engineering was established as a discipline
In the 1970s software engineering had more structured programming
In the 2000s there was the beginning of more agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: gather requirements, define scope, goals, and resources
Design: create the architecture and design of the software
Implementation: write the code to build the software
Testing: verify that the built software meets requirements and fixes bugs
Deployment: Release the software for use
Maintenance: provide ongoing updates and support

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential; following a strict order (requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing) with a heavy emphasis on documentation. Meanwhile, Agile methodology is iterative in short cycles with the requirements evolving throughout a project. Waterfall methodology is suitable for scenarios where the requirements are well-defined in a stable environment with strict regulatory compliance. Agile is the best for scenarios where project requirements change and there is close collaboration with the customer. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software engineer: writes codes and implements software solutions
Quality assurance engineer: designs and executes test plans to ensure software quality
project manager: oversees planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, testing, and debugging code. Visual Studio is an example of an IDE. VCS enables tracking of changes from source codes and facilitates collaboration. Git and Subversion are great examples.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements: which can be solved by using agile methodology
Tight deadlines: prioritization of tasks strategy would help alleviate pressure
Technical debt

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individual components in isolation. It's important for finding bugs early and ensuring code quality.
Integration testing tests how different components work together and it is important for verifying interactions between modules.
System testing tests the entire system as a whole and is important for validating performance and functionality
Acceptance testing tests if the software meets user requirements. It ensures user satisfaction and software readiness


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective instructions (prompts) to get the desired and precise output from AI models. Prompt engineering is important to ensure accurate, relevant and specific responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt "Write something about dogs"
Improved: "Write a 4-sentence description of German Shepherd dog breed, focusing on their size and popularity."
Why improved version is effective: clearly specifies the type of content (a description). Specifically mentions the breed and area of focus. It's concise setting the length of the response (4 sentences)
